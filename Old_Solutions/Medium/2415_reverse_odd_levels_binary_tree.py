Task:
    Given the root of a perfect binary tree,
    reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

    For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are [2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18],
    then it should become [18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2].
    Return the root of the reversed tree.

    A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

    The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

Topics:
    Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

What I learned:
    - Perfect Trees: Special type of binary tree where:
          - Every parent has exactly 2 children
          - All leaf nodes are at the same level
          - BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal using queue (deque) is perfect for level-by-level operations
          - Level tracking helps with specific level operations (like reversing levels)
          - Tree values can be modified while keeping the structure intact
