## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: I didn't encounter any difficulties

### What I Learned
- New concept: ~ (not) operator inverts all the bits, which means it changes 0 to -1 and 1 to -2, which is handy for indexing from the end of the array
- Mistake to avoid: I keep using while loops where I can use for loops
- Better approach: After writing a solution with a while loop, think about how to convert it to a for loop
