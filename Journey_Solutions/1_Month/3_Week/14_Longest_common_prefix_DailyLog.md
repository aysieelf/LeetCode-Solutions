## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ✓
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: There was an easier min/all solution that I couldn't think of.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Three different approaches to solving the problem:
  - Iterative approach (my initial solution)
  - min/all approach (more elegant and readable)
  - Trie structure (suitable for more complex text problems)
- Mistake to avoid: The most obvious solution isn't always the best one. Sometimes a simpler approach (like min/all) is more elegant and easier to maintain.
- Better approach: Using built-in Python functions like min() and all() makes the code more readable and efficient. The sorting approach is also an interesting alternative with O(NlogN) time complexity.
