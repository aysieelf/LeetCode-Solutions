## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ✓
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Initially implemented with sorting (O(n log n)) before optimizing to hash table solution (O(n))

### What I Learned
- New concept: Hash tables provide O(1) lookup time, making them more efficient than sorting for frequency-based problems
- Mistake to avoid: Don't default to sorting for frequency comparison problems
- Better approach: Using defaultdict(int) eliminates the need for explicit dictionary initialization and key existence checks
