#### Time Complexity Legend:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n log n): Linear-logarithmic time
- O(n¬≤): Quadratic time
- O(2‚Åø): Exponential time

#### Status Legend:
* ‚úÖ - Solved completely on my own (might not be optimal)
* üü° - Needed help (but then solved)
* ‚ùå - Couldn't solve without solution

### Weekly Stats
- Total Problems: 7
- Independent Solutions: 7
- Success Rate: 100%

### Areas of Improvement
- [x] Understanding when to use Hash Tables (O(n)) vs Sorting (O(n log n))
- [x] Building confidence in implementing optimal solutions first
- [x] Reading and understanding the problem statement more carefully
- [x] Choosing better variable names for improved readability
- [x] Thinking of ways around built-in functions to improve time complexity
- [x] Learning to recognize when simpler solutions (like min/all) might be better than more complex approaches

### Celebrations üéâ
- Achievement 1: Improved solution from O(n log n) to O(n) complexity
- Achievement 2: Implemented optimal Two Pointers solution for Valid Palindrome with O(1) space complexity completely on my own
- Achievement 3: Implemented optimal Two Pointers solution for Reverse String completely on my own
- Achievement 4: Implemented a Hash Table solution for First Unique Character in a String completely on my own (though not optimal)
- Achievement 5: Solve Length of last word with 100% time complexity and O(1) space complexity
- Achievement 6: Successfully implemented a working solution for Longest Common Prefix independently in 16 minutes, though learned about more elegant approaches afterward (min/all and sorting approaches)
- Achievement 7: Found and implemented optimal Stack solution for Valid Parentheses completely on my own
