## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ✓
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - When going back-to-front in an array, I can use a for loop instead of a while loop.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Using for loop with range(len-1, -1, -1) is more elegant for back-to-front array iteration than while loop with counter
- Mistake to avoid: Over-complicating the solution with unnecessary variables (extra_one, curr_sum) when simpler logic would suffice
- Better approach: Use in-place modification for better space complexity, only create new array elements when absolutely necessary (like in 999->1000 case)

### Performance Rating
- First Try: 🟢
- Understanding: 🟢
- Implementation: 🟡
