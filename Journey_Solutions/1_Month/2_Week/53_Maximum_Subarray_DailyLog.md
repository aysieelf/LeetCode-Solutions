## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - Successful implementation of first working solution (O(n^2))
  - Quickly understood and implemented Kadane's Algorithm after guidance (O(n))
  - Created a very efficient implementation that beats 90% in time complexity

### What I Learned
- New concept: Kadane's Algorithm (Dynamic Programming) - This algorithm is used to find the maximum subarray sum in an array. It is a very efficient algorithm with O(n) time complexity.
- Mistake to avoid: Don't try to use sliding window when a simpler DP solution exists
- Better approach: Sometimes direct comparisons are better than using built-in functions like max()
