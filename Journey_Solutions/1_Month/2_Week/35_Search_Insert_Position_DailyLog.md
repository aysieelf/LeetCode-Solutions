## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - Initially overcomplicated the solution by adding special cases for arrays of length 2 and using three pointers instead of the standard binary search approach. The solution worked but was more complex than necessary.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Binary Search can be used not just for finding elements, but also for finding insertion positions in sorted arrays
- Mistake to avoid: Don't overcomplicate binary search with special cases - the standard template handles all cases elegantly
- Better approach: Use the standard binary search template with left pointer as the natural insertion point
