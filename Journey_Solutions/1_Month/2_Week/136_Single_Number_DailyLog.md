## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Successfully implemented initial solution using set, but needed help understanding the optimal XOR approach

### What I Learned
- New concept: Bit manipulation offers powerful operators - XOR can be used to track unique numbers by automatically handling duplicates in the result
- Mistake to avoid: Using extra space when a constant space complexity solution is possible
- Better approach: Using XOR to eliminate duplicates rather than using a set

### Performance Rating
- First Try: üü°
- Understanding: üü°
- Implementation: üü¢
