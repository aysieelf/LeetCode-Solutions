## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [ ] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Didn't need to go back-to-front.

### What I Learned
- New concept: I can use two pointers front to back to solve this problem.
- Mistake to avoid: I went back-to-front without thinking about if it was necessary.
- Better approach: I can use the two-pointer approach to solve this problem - front to back, and don't need to swap places. Just getting the needed number to it's place, because it doesn't matter what's left in the array.
