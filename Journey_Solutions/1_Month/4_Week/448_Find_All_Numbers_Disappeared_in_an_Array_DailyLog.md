## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: None - the problem was straightforward with a clear set-based solution

### What I Learned
- New concept: Using a set for O(1) lookup is often more efficient than repeatedly searching through an array
- Mistake to avoid: Don't overcomplicate the solution - sometimes the straightforward approach is best
- Better approach: While there exists an O(1) space solution using array modification, the set-based solution is cleaner, easier to understand, and performs well in practice
