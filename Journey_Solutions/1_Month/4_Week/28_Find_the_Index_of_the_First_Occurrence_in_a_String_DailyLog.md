## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ✓
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: I had to use three pointers because I didn't want to slice.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Slicing sometimes is the best approach.
- Mistake to avoid: Avoiding slicing can make the code more complex.
- Better approach: Slicing from the index till index + len(substring) can make the code cleaner.
