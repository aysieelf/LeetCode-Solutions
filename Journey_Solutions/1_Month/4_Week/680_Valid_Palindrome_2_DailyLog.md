## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Initially tried to use a boolean flag to track character deletion, which made the logic overly complex. Failed to consider the need to check both possibilities (skipping left or right character) when encountering a mismatch.

### What I Learned
- New concept: When checking for almost-palindromes, we need to consider both possibilities of character deletion at the point of mismatch
- Mistake to avoid: Don't overcomplicate the solution with boolean flags when you can solve it with simple string slicing or two separate checks
- Better approach: Use Python's built-in string slicing and reverse comparison for cleaner, more readable code. Split the problem into two cases: skip left character or skip right character when mismatch is found
