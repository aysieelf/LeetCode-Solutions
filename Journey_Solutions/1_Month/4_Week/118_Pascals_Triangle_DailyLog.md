## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Handling edge cases
- [ ] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: I had difficulties in finding the right approach to solve the problem.

### What I Learned
- New concept: I learned about Pascal's Triangle and how to generate it using dynamic programming.
- Mistake to avoid: I tried to find a different approach instead of just doing what the triangle does - adding the two numbers above to get the current number.
- Better approach: I should have tried to understand the problem better and find the simplest solution
