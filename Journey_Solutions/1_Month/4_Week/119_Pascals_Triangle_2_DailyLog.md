## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [ ] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Initially created new arrays unnecessarily, leading to suboptimal space complexity

### What I Learned
- New concept: In-place array updates can optimize space complexity
- Mistake to avoid: Creating new arrays when existing array can be modified
- Better approach: Update array from right to left to avoid overwriting needed values
