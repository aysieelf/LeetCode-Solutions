## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [ ] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - Initially tried using nested loops which was O(n¬≤)
  - Tried to track both max and min with indices which was overcomplicated 
  - Needed help to understand the DP approach

### What I Learned
- New concept: Dynamic Programming (State Tracking) - (min_price, max_profit) instead of tracking all data
- Mistake to avoid: Don't overcomplicate by tracking indices when unnecessary
- Better approach: 
  - Process data sequentially while maintaining minimal state
  - In Python, if/else can be faster than min/max functions
  - The order of operations can affect performance

### Performance Rating
- First Try: üî¥
- Understanding: üü¢
- Implementation: üü¢
