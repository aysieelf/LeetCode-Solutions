## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - Successfully implemented early exit hash map solution in just 4 minutes, then learned and implemented Boyer-Moore algorithm.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm - treating element counting as voting
- Mistake to avoid: Sorting is O(n log n) - stop using it when you don't need it
- Better approach:  Using Boyer-Moore instead of hash map for better space complexity

### Performance Rating
- First Try: üü¢
- Understanding: üü¢
- Implementation: üü¢
