## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ✓
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: 
  - Initially used a less optimal approach that always traverses the entire array

### What I Learned
- New concept:
  - Early exit approach can increase performance drastically
- Mistake to avoid: 
  - No need to traverse the entire array if we find a duplicate
- Better approach:
  - Using Hash Set with Early Exit instead of Set Length Comparison

### Performance Rating
- First Try: 🟢
- Understanding: 🟢
- Implementation: 🟢
