### Weekly Stats
- Total Problems: 6
- Independent Solutions: 5
- Success Rate: 83%

### Areas of Improvement
- [x] Write cleaner code
- [x] Avoid using built-in methods without knowing their time complexity
- [x] Think about edge cases before writing code
- [x] Learn to recognize when back-to-front approach might be better
- [x] Practice analyzing time complexity of different approaches
- [x] Practice more with Python's tuple unpacking for cleaner swaps
- [x] Think about optimization opportunities without compromising readability
- [x] Practice identifying patterns in problems
- [ ] Study different approaches to the same problem (hash set vs sorting)

### Celebrations 🎉
- Achievement 1: I came up with Hash Table with Parallel Processing for Two Sum which made my solution faster than 100% of submissions. 🚀
- Achievement 2: I solved merge sorted array in 22 minutes on my own. 🏆
- Achievement 3: Successfully implemented Two Pointers pattern and improved my solution from O(n²) to O(n) for Merge Sorted Array. 🎯
- Achievement 4: Learned to write cleaner code with better variable naming (i1, j2 instead of i, j)! 📝
- Achievement 5: Solved Move Zeroes independently in just 13 minutes! 🚀
- Achievement 6: Successfully identified and implemented Two Pointers pattern again, showing pattern recognition skills! 🎯
- Achievement 7: Demonstrated good problem-solving instincts by trying to optimize the solution (even though it didn't work out, the thinking process was valuable!) 💡
- Achievement 8: Wrote clean, well-documented code with clear variable names and edge cases! 📝
- Achievement 9: Successfully implemented Prefix Sum pattern for Running Sum of 1d Array! 🚀
- Achievement 10: Solved Contains Duplicate independently in just 1 minute! 🚀
- Learned and implemented my first Dynamic Programming solution with Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock! 🎯
