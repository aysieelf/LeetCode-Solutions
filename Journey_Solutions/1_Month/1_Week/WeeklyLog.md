- O(2ⁿ): Exponential time

### Weekly Stats
- Total Problems: 3
- Success Rate: 100%

### Areas of Improvement
- [x] Write cleaner code
- [x] Avoid using built-in methods without knowing their time complexity
- [x] Think about edge cases before writing code
- [ ] Learn to recognize when back-to-front approach might be better
- [ ] Practice analyzing time complexity of different approaches
- [ ] Practice more with Python's tuple unpacking for cleaner swaps
- [ ] Think about optimization opportunities without compromising readability

### Celebrations 🎉
- Achievement 1: I came up with Hash Table with Parallel Processing for Two Sum which made my solution faster than 100% of submissions. 🚀
- Achievement 2: I solved merge sorted array in 22 minutes on my own. 🏆
- Achievement 3: Successfully implemented Two Pointers pattern and improved my solution from O(n²) to O(n) for Merge Sorted Array. 🎯
- Achievement 4: Learned to write cleaner code with better variable naming (i1, j2 instead of i, j)! 📝
- Achievement 5: Solved Move Zeroes independently in just 13 minutes! 🚀
- Achievement 6: Successfully identified and implemented Two Pointers pattern again, showing pattern recognition skills! 🎯
- Achievement 7: Demonstrated good problem-solving instincts by trying to optimize the solution (even though it didn't work out, the thinking process was valuable!) 💡
- Achievement 8: Wrote clean, well-documented code with clear variable names and edge cases! 📝
