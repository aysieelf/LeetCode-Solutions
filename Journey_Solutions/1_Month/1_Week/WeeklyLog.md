### Weekly Stats
- Total Problems: 2
- Success Rate: 200%

### Areas of Improvement
- [ ] Write cleaner code
- [ ] Avoid using built-in methods without knowing their time complexity
- [ ] Think about edge cases before writing code
- [ ] Learn to recognize when back-to-front approach might be better
- [ ] Practice analyzing time complexity of different approaches

### Celebrations 🎉
- Achievement 1: I came up with Hash Table with Parallel Processing for Two Sum which made my solution faster than 100% of submissions. 🚀
- Achievement 2: I solved merge sorted array in 22 minutes on my own. 🏆
- Achievement 3: Successfully implemented Two Pointers pattern and improved my solution from O(n²) to O(n) for Merge Sorted Array. 🎯
- Achievement 4: Learned to write cleaner code with better variable naming (i1, j2 instead of i, j)! 📝
