## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered:
  - I successfully identified why the first approach was O(n^2) and how to optimize it to O(n) on my own.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Prefix Sum pattern - we keep track of the sum of elements up to the current index to avoid recalculating it every time.
- Mistake to avoid: Avoid slicing the array to calculate the sum of elements up to the current index. It's O(k) time complexity where k is the length of the slice.
- Better approach: Use last element of the result array to calculate the sum of elements up to the current index.
