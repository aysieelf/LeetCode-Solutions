## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: No significant difficulties. Initial implementation was clean and efficient using defaultdict. Later learned about an even more optimal XOR solution.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Using XOR operation for finding the unique element. XOR properties: a‚äïa=0 and a‚äï0=a can be used to eliminate duplicates.
- Mistake to avoid: Using generic variable names like 'map' - better to use descriptive names like 'char_count'.
- Better approach: While HashMap solution is good (O(n) time, O(1) space), the XOR solution provides better space complexity and more elegant implementation.
