## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: No significant difficulties. Immediately recognized the frequency counting pattern and implemented it efficiently.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Using defaultdict(int) for cleaner frequency counting without explicit initialization
- Mistake to avoid: Not checking length early (potential optimization)
- Better approach: Adding early exit check for length comparison can improve performance in some cases

### Performance Rating
