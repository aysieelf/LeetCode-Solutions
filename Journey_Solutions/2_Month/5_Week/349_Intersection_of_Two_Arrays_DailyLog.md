## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: None! Successfully implemented the set intersection approach on first try.

### What I Learned
- New concept: Different approaches to solve intersection problems (Set Operations, Two Pointers, Binary Search)
- Mistake to avoid: Creating sets from both arrays when we only need to convert the smaller one
- Better approach: Check array lengths first and convert only the smaller array to set for better memory usage

### Performance Rating
- First Try: üü¢
- Understanding: üü¢
- Implementation: üü¢
