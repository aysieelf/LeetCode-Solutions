## Problem Analysis
### What Went Smoothly ‚úì
- [x] Understanding the problem
- [x] Finding the right approach
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Handling edge cases
- [x] Understanding time complexity
- Details of difficulties encountered: Successfully identified and handled the tricky edge case where same word appears multiple times (e.g., "dog dog dog dog" with pattern "abba")

### What I Learned
- New concept: Bijection - one-to-one correspondence between two sets
- Mistake to avoid: Always test with cases where same value maps to different keys
- Better approach: Using two hash maps provides clearer logic and better readability than trying to use a single map

### Performance Rating
- First Try: üü¢ - Completed independently, including finding and fixing edge cases
- Understanding: üü¢ - Can explain the concept of bijection and why we need two-way mapping
- Implementation: üü° - Wrote clean code with good variable names and efficient approach
