# 🚀 My LeetCode Journey

## 🔄 Why I Changed My Approach

Inspired by [this amazing story](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/716202/amz-google-facebook-offer-reject-reject-my-journey-from-failure-to-offer-at-faang), I transformed my approach to focus on building strong foundations first.
