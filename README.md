# 🚀 My LeetCode Journey

## 🔄 Why I Changed My Approach
After struggling with daily LeetCode challenges (mostly Medium/Hard) and feeling overwhelmed, I realized I needed a more structured learning path. Inspired by [this amazing story](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/716202/amz-google-facebook-offer-reject-reject-my-journey-from-failure-to-offer-at-faang), I transformed my approach to focus on building strong foundations first.
